# Ping-Pong-
This is a project made to apply my uses of collision detection into a more integrated and fun experience. This was extremely fun to code!
It has many options within the project. 
The menu allows the user to exit, resume or to options. If paused the game does stop. See Ping Pong/bin/Debug/Ping Pong.exe to run and play the game.
Resume - Obviously just resumes the game.
Options - Applies new menu to increase dificulty and change the background colour.
Exit - Gives the option to close the program.
Have Fun!
